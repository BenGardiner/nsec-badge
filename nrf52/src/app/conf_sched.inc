While translating individual instructions to their corresponding assembly representations is doable, producing a correct and complete representation of a whole executable is indeed another story. This adventure includes dealing with numerous compilers' peculiarities, such as switch-case constructions, position-independent code and control-flow optimizations, while struggling with theoretically intractable questions, such as code and data distinction.  In this talk, we would like to dig into the internals of our own disassembler engine, which is part of JEB reverse-engineering platform. This component produces an assembly-like representation of a whole binary object, in particular for MIPS, ARM/ARM64 and x86/x64 executables, and has been developed fully in-house over the last three years.  During this presentation, we will describe in particular:   the design choices behind our disassembler engine. We will explain how we developed most of the logic in a generic way, while trying to keep architecture-specific parts contained, and how the disassembler employs different strategies depending of the architecture and the identified compiler.   the use of a so-called \"advanced\" analysis pass, based on a custom intermediate representation (IR), which allows us to compute possible runtime values in the same way on all architectures. We will explain in particular the design of our IR, and the way we translated native instructions to the IR.   the implementation of signatures on machine code, such that classic statically linked libraries are automatically identified. We will dig into the problems that the generation, storage and matching of such signatures brought.   the various techniques and tests we developed to assess the disassembler correctness.   Finally, dealing with several (quite different) architectures forced us to very often reassess our assumptions on what machine code is supposed to look like. Throughout this presentation, we will describe the mistakes and wrong assumptions we made, in the hope that it will be useful to fellow security researchers dealing with machine code.",

Companies all too often decide that security best practices aren't worth the extra resources.  And corporate responsibility if often thought of as an obligation to shareholders. But as customers, employees and community members, don't we want to see more than that? This talk explores the obligations that companies have to their user base, and the ways that community expectations can lead to stronger security practices. We'll begin with an exploration of the nature of community and corporate obligation, drawing from traditional philosophical approaches across culture. Some examples we'll explore:   Even young, scrappy crypto companies will not launch until they have a pen test, referred to as an \"audit report.\" There is no legislation requiring this, but it's become part of the culture. What can we learn from this, to potentially encourage adoption of similar practices in the broader startup community? (Is that even desirable?)   It's accepted that social media companies minimize the use of full time moderators, because that would be expensive. But this comes at a real psychological cost to users. Companies like Facebook and Twitter failed to stop the spread of a violent viral video on March 14th and 15th, despite requests from authorities in New Zealand and complaints from sensitive customers worldwide. What were Facebook and Twitter's obligations here? How does cost factor in?

    .detailed = "The RDP protocol has a wide variety of interesting features, yet no tool supported the complexity of the RDP protocol for information security purposes. Inspired by RDPY, we created PyRDP, an open-source general-purpose RDP man-in-the-middle tool. This presentation will cover use cases for PyRDP in malware research and pentesting. First, we added new features to our project to help with malware research. One crucial feature is the ability to rewrite the username and password sent to the server. This is used to allow access to the target RDP server to anyone using any credentials, which maximizes hostile interactions. Our tool also saves full RDP sessions to disk as well as clipboard content and files transferred during the sessions. Having session replays allows us to extract tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) from malicious actors. By using our tool and pointing it to a real RDP server, we created a fully interactive honeypot and caught a malware actor in the act. We will do a demonstration of these features and show replays of the malware actor we caught. Second, in a corporate environment, RDP is oftentimes used by high-privilege user accounts to manage Active Directory, servers, users' workstations and more. Using RDP is so ingrained in day-to-day tasks that users stop thinking about the potential consequences of connecting to random machines. We will present PyRDP's use cases in pentesting engagements and propose an approach to compromising high-privileged accounts. A man-in-the-middle in an RDP context can be used to capture credentials, but it can do more. Instead of reusing the credentials to launch another connection, attackers can interactively hijack the existing connection and disguise their actions as coming from the victim. Additionnally, it can lead to the partial compromise of the client machine by abusing features such as drive redirection to enumerate and download sensitive files. PyRDP can also be used to challenge the incident response process by attracting the incident response team to a machine and capturing their credentials as they connect. Finally, the replay files produced by PyRDP can be used to demonstrate the impact of compromise to high-level executives. The talk will cover these attack scenarios in depth and will end with a short demo of the open-source tool and its capabilities.",

Cisco Meeting Server or CMS is a software used to make video conferences, which allows users to connect to meetings through different clients or via WebRTC with a browser. During a series of tests conducted with this software, we detected that remotely and without authentication it is possible to list the active conferences on a CMS server and obtain a large amount of information for each conference such as the name of the conference, ID, video address, passcode protection and more. After our report, in November 2018 Cisco published a security advisory associated with this vulnerability with CVE-2018-15446. We also detect that remotely and without authentication, in some cases it is possible to perform a bruteforce attack of the passcode in the conferences that have one, to obtain this numeric code and access the corresponding videoconference. Based on this research, we developed two open source tools in Python: m33tfinder and m33tbreak that allow to automate this attack, knowing only the URL of the CMS server. An attacker using our tools could identify the URL of the CMS of a certain company, obtain the valid conferences, identify the conferences that discuss critical issues such as budgets, directive committees, board meetings and join the meetings as a guest. That way the attacker could access the critical information discussed in them or record them, using only a web browser. In our talk, we will see the overall security of videoconferencing systems, the story of how we discovered the vulnerability, how to identify the Cisco Meeting Servers exposed on the Internet, the technique used to obtain information about the conferences and perform the bruteforce attack, a demo of the tools to carry out an attack on a CMS and the countermeasures we can take to protect ourselves from these attacks in case of administering or using this or another videoconferencing system.",

In 2018, GoSecure introduced a new class of attack known as Edge Side Include Injections, exploiting a design flaw introduced nearly two decades ago in popular caching servers and cache providing solutions. Again in 2018, James Kettle released his research on Web Cache Poisoning, which leverages unkeyed input to reflect arbitrary data in an HTTP response in order to get a cross-site-scripting payload cached across users. The findings from this research show the obvious flaws we failed to identify in caching specifications for so long. This talk aims to be a precautionary tale for the next time you need to implement a web caching solution by providing a practical overview of caching attacks in web applications.

The event highlighted how many applications used unsafe deserialization. At the time, Jenkins, WebLogic, WebSphere and JBoss used the same vulnerable code pattern. Two years later, researchers turned to the .NET ecosystem and discovered that many serialization libraries were vulnerable to similar attacks. In 2018, vulnerabilities were found notably in SharePoint (Workflows API), PHP-BB (using a new PHP vector) and many more. Hundreds of CVEs were recorded for the same year proving that deserialization is still an active threat for modern web applications. Developers and pentesters can't ignore this risk because, in most cases, it leads to remote code execution.  This 3-hour workshop will go through the basics of exploiting such vulnerabilities in multiple languages including Java, .NET and PHP.

The workshop aims to be fitting for people with varying background, as it starts easy and with detailed explanation on hands-on exercises but increases difficulty over time. The workshop is a good fit for attendees who already know about buffer overflows but want to go further. For them it's a perfect next step which will take their exploiting skills to the next level! The basic example of exploiting a buffer overflow is pushing shellcode on the stack and jumping to it. This is successful when there are no security mechanisms. But how can we get a shell if the stack is not executable? Return Oriented Programming (ROP) is a neat technique to defeat this protection.   In this workshop, we will step up the game by turning on the NX-bit and using ROP to exploit the buffer overflow anyway. The basic idea of ROP is to use code snippets that are already in the binary. This way, we can put the shellcode together like we would tinker a blackmailing letter from old newsletters, putting the fitting pieces one after another, until we get the payload we want. We will work on Linux (x86), get to know the libc, and debug the process. By observing the stack and registers, we will see how choosing code snippets that end with a 'return' (ROP-gagdets) plays out. The workshop contains 3 exercises of different stages.  The first stage is 32 Bit to get an easy start and to get to know the environment and commands. This exercise is done together, to get a quick and efficient example on how to interact with the tools. The second stage is 64 Bit, to stress the differences regarding e.g. calling conventions. This exercise will allow the attendees to explore the exploit on their own, with my assistance when needed.   The 3rd stage will be solving the challenge with ASLR turned on (without PIE). This will get us a longer ROP-Chain, we will have a look on other useful segments like the Global Offset Table and how to use this for exploitation. Also, the combination of using ROP on 64 Bit with ASLR turned on can score you some points in CTFs. I will provide a VM with the binaries and my presentation on it. Using a common system is the easiest way to get the same offsets in our address calculation. I will also provide instructions to set up the VM in case the attendees want to set up their own VM.",

Its promise was to get Internet search results based on your relations on social networks. Wajam was free to install. To start monetizing the software, they started adding ads to search results. Gradually, Wajam began acting more and more like adware: they used pay-per-install platforms to distribute the application, obfuscation and even kernel drivers (rootkit) to hide their malicious behavior from users and security products.  According to D&B Hoovers, the net benefits made by the company were estimated to $CAD 4.2M in 2013. After being investigated, the Privacy Commissioner of Canada reported in 2017 that Wajam Internet Technologies breaches the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA). This did not stop their activities: they quickly sold all assets to a virtual company based in Hong Kong to avoid Canadian authorities. In late-2018, new samples targeting both Windows and macOS emerged and were quickly linked to Wajam. This talk will detail the technical findings of these recent variants and how they are related to the previous techniques used by Wajam.
